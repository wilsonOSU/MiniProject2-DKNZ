# MiniProject2-DKNZ
## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to figure out which clients will subscribe for a term deposit and which ones will not. Exploratory Data Analysis will be 
conducted to figure out which variables have the most correlation with each other and gather other insights from the data that will be helpful in coming to a 
conclusion. Multiple models will be built and compared to find the best prediction model for this data. In total, our group made six different models. 

At the end of our analysis, we concluded that the best course of action for the bank to keep customers subscribing for a term deposit is to keep potential 
customers engaged.
